               <p>In the screenshots below you see the basic functionality of a cash register.</p>
               <p>This was my first experience with dictionarys in C# and I learned a lot with this particular mimic project.</p>
               <p>The idea with this project is that it's meant to mimic an API for a (imaginary) franchise<br> known as Cole's Stop and Shop. <br>Franchiees would hypothetically have this software implemented in their store when a new location is opened.</p>
               <p>This console app first gets the user (cashier) to enter item id's which is meant to mimic the action of scanning bar codes on items.</p>
               <p>After items are scanned and the cashier presses the key to finalize it prints the receipt<br> calculated with provincial and federal tax.</p>

               <p>My idea with this project was to mimic a possible zoo keeping system <br>that would be used in a zoo from an management perspective.</p>
               <p>There is 4 different menus. The main menu allows the user to enter either 3 different sub menus.<br> Employee management, equipment management, and animal management.</p>
               <p>Each menu allows the administrator to add/remove attributes associated with the zoo.</p>

               <p>This project sparked out of a joke with a peer. I decided to make a mimic program that would represent<br> something like AirB&B (for fun of course)</p>
               <p>There will be a menu for Home owners to list their property, and a menu for renters to rent a property. <br>At this moment the only functionality I have implemented is just creating the property object <br>that will be accessed in both the renter and user interface.</p>
